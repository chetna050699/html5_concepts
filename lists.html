<!--
    There are three types of links html provides they are Ordered lists,unordered lists,description Lists
-->

<!--Ordered lists

    An ordered list can be created with the <ol> tag and each list item can be created with the <li> tag as in the
example below:
<ol>
<li>Item</li>
<li>Another Item</li>
<li>Yet Another Item</li>
</ol>
This will produce a numbered list (which is the default style):
1. Item
2. Another Item
3. Yet Another Item




-->

<!--Unordered lists

    An unordered list can be created with the <ul> tag and each list item can be created with the <li> tag as shown by
the example below:
<ul>
<li>Item</li>
<li>Another Item</li>
<li>Yet Another Item</li>
</ul>
This will produce a bulleted list (which is the default style):
Item
Another Item
Yet Another Item


-->


<!--
Description List

A description list (or definition list, as it was called before HTML5) can be created with the dl element. It consists of

name-value groups, where the name is given in the dt element, and the value is given in the dd element.
<dl>
<dt>name 1</dt>
<dd>value for 1</dd>
<dt>name 2</dt>
<dd>value for 2</dd>
</dl>
