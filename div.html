    The div element in HTML is a container element that encapsulates other elements and can be used to group and
separate parts of a webpage. A div by itself does not inherently represent anything but is a powerful tool in web
design. This topic covers the purpose and applications of the div element.


The <div> element usually has no specific semantic meaning by itself, simply representing a division, and is typically
used for grouping and encapsulating other elements within an HTML document and separating those from other
groups of content. As such, each <div> is best described by its contents.
<div>
<p>Hello! This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
The div element is typically a block-level element, meaning that it separates a block of an HTML document and
occupying the maximum width of the page. Browsers typically have the following default CSS rule:
div {
display:block;
}
