    Void Elements

    Not all HTML tags are of the same structure. While most elements require an opening tag, a closing tag, and
contents, some elements - known as void elements - only require an opening tag as they themselves do not contain
any elements. This topic explains and demonstrates the proper usage of void elements in HTML.
