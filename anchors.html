<!--
   
href

Specifies the destination address. It can be an absolute or relative URL, or the name of an anchor. An
absolute URL is the complete URL of a website like http://example.com/. A relative URL points to
another directory and/or document inside the same website, e.g. /about-us/ points to the directory
“about-us” inside the root directory (/). When pointing to another directory without explicitly specifying
the document, web servers typically return the document “index.html” inside that directory.
hreflang Specifies the language of the resource linked by the href attribute (which must be present with this
one). Use language values from BCP 47 for HTML5 and RFC 1766 for HTML 4.


rel 

Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document. For HTML5, the
values must be defined in the specification or registered in the Microformats wiki.


target


Specifies where to open the link, e.g. in a new tab or window. Possible values are _blank, _self,
_parent, _top, and framename (deprecated). Forcing such behaviour is not recommended since it
violates the control of the user over a website.


title


Specifies extra information about a link. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when
the cursor moves over the link. This attribute is not restricted to links, it can be used on almost all
HTML tags.


download


Specifies that the target will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink. The value of the
attribute will be the name of the downloaded file. There are no restrictions on allowed values, and the
browser will automatically detect the correct file extension and add it to the file (.img, .pdf, etc.). If the
value is omitted, the original filename is used.
