    Some character may be reserved for HTML and cannot be used directly as it may obstruct the actual HTML codes.
For example, trying to display the left and right angle brackets (<>) in the source code may cause unexpected
results in the output. Similarly, white spaces as written in the source code may not display as expected in the
output HTML. Some, like ☎, are not available in the ASCII character set.
For this purpose, character entities are created. These are of the form &entity_name; or &entity_number;. The
following are some of the available HTML entities.
Character Description Entity Name Entity Number
“ ” non-breaking space &nbsp; &#160;
“<” less than &lt; &#60;
“>” greater than &gt; &#62;
“&” ampersand &amp; &#38;
“—” em dash &mdash; &#8212;
“–” en dash &ndash; &#8211;
“©” copyright &copy; &#169;
“®” registered trademark &reg; &#174;
“™” trademark &trade; &#8482;
“☎” phone &phone; &#9742;
