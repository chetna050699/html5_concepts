    The Action Attribute
The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted, which usually leads to a script
that collects the information submitted and works with it. if you leave it blank, it will send it to the same file
<form action="action.php">

    The Method Attribute
The method attribute is used to define the HTTP method of the form which is either GET or POST.
<form action="action.php" method="get">
<form action="action.php" method="post">

    Uploading Files
Images and files can be uploaded/submitted to server by setting enctype attribute of form tag to multipart/formdata.
enctype specifies how form data would be encoded while submitting to the server.
Example
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="upload.php">
<input type="file" name="pic" />
<input type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>

Grouping of few input fields


While designing a form, you might like to group a few input fields into a group to help organise the form layout.
This can be done by using the tag . Here is an example for using it.
For each fieldset, you can set a legend for the set using the tag LEGEND TEXT
Example
<form>
<fieldset>
<legend>1st field set:</legend>
Field one:<br>
<input type="text"><br>
GoalKicker.com â€“ HTML5 Notes for Professionals 56
Field two:<br>
<input type="text"><br>
</fieldset><br>
<fieldset>
<legend>2nd field set:</legend>
Field three:<br>
<input type="text"><br>
Field four:<br>
<input type="text"><br>
</fieldset><br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
