<!--
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses a markup system composed of elements which represent specific
content. Markup means that with HTML you declare what is presented to a viewer, not how it is presented. Visual
representations are defined by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and realized by browsers. Still existing elements that
allow for such, like e.g. font, "are entirely obsolete, and must not be used by authors"[1].
HTML is sometimes called a programming language but it has no logic, so is a markup language. HTML tags
provide semantic meaning and machine-readability to the content in the page.
An element usually consists of an opening tag (<element_name>), a closing tag (</element_name>), which contain the
element's name surrounded by angle brackets, and the content in between:
<element_name>...content...</element_name>
There are some HTML elements that don't have a closing tag or any contents. These are called void elements. Void
elements include <img>, <meta>, <link> and <input>.
Element names can be thought of as descriptive keywords for the content they contain, such as video, audio,
table, footer.
A HTML page may consist of potentially hundreds of elements which are then read by a web browser, interpreted
and rendered into human readable or audible content on the screen.
For this document it is important to note the difference between elements and tags:
Elements: video, audio, table, footer
Tags: <video>, <audio>, <table>, <footer>, </html>, </body>

These are the tags used in the example:
Tag Meaning
<!DOCTYPE> Defines the HTML version used in the document. In this case it is HTML5.
See the doctypes topic for more information.
<html>
Opens the page. No markup should come after the closing tag (</html>). The lang attribute declares
the primary language of the page using the ISO language codes (en for English).
See the Content Language topic for more information.
<head>
Opens the head section, which does not appear in the main browser window but mainly contains
information about the HTML document, called metadata. It can also contain imports from external
stylesheets and scripts. The closing tag is </head>.
<meta>
Gives the browser some metadata about the document. The charset attribute declares the character
encoding. Modern HTML documents should always use UTF-8, even though it is not a requirement. In
HTML, the <meta> tag does not require a closing tag.
See the Meta topic for more information.
<title> The title of the page. Text written between this opening and the closing tag (</title>) will be
displayed on the tab of the page or in the title bar of the browser.
<body> Opens the part of the document displayed to users, i.e. all the visible or audible content of a page. No
content should be added after the closing tag </body>.
