<!--
    <input>
elements are used within a <form> element to declare input controls that allow users to input data.
Syntax
<input type="text">
or (without specifying a type, using the default attribute):
<input>
The default width of a text field input is 20 characters. This can be changed by specifying a value for the size
attribute like this:
<input type="text" size="50">
-->

<!--
    <input type="checkbox">
<input type="radio">


Example:
<input type="radio" name="color" id="red" value="#F00">
<input type="radio" name="color" id="green" value="#0F0">
<input type="radio" name="color" id="blue" value="#00F">
-->

<!--
    Accessibility
Labels
To give context to the buttons and show users what each button is for, each of them should have a label. This can
be done using a <label> element to wrap the button. Also, this makes the label clickable, so you select the
corresponding button.
Example:
<label>
<input type="radio" name="color" value="#F00">
Red
</label>
or with a <label> element with a for attribute set to the id attribute of the button:
<input type="checkbox" name="color" value="#F00" id="red">
<label for="red">Red</label>

    input validations


    Input Validation
HTML input validation is done automatically by the browser based on special attributes on the input element. It
could partially or completely replace JavaScript input validation. This kind of validation can be circumvented by the
user via specially crafted HTTP requests, so it does not replace server-side input validation. The validation only
occurs when attempting to submit the form, so all restricted inputs must be inside a form in order for validation to
occur (unless you're using JavaScript). Keep in mind that inputs which are disabled or read-only will not trigger
validation.
Some newer input types (like email, url, tel, date and many more ) are automatically validated and do not require
your own validation constraints.
Version ≥ 5
Required
Use the required attribute to indicate that a field must be completed in order to pass validation.
<input required>
Minimum / Maximum Length
Use the minlength and maxlength attributes to indicate length requirements. Most browsers will prevent the user
from typing more than max characters into the box, preventing them from making their entry invalid even before
they attempt submission.
<input minlength="3">
<input maxlength="15">
<input minlength="3" maxlength="15">
-->

<!--
    Specifying a range
Use min and max attributes to restrict the range of numbers a user can input into an input of type number or range
Marks: <input type="number" size="6" name="marks" min="0" max="100" />
Subject Feedback: <input type="range" size="2" name="feedback" min="1" max="5" />
Version ≥ 5
